# Problem 3: Convergence of Forces wrt to plane-wave cutoff energies

Oftentimes we are interested in quantities other than energies. In this problem, we will be calculating forces on atoms. Displace a Ge atom +0.05 in the z direction (fractional coordinates). Keeping other parameters fixed, calculate the forces on a Ge atom as a function of the kinetic energy cutoff. A good force value would be converged to within around 10 meV/Angstrom (convert this to Ry/bohr, since PWscf gives forces in Ry/bohr). Record relevant parameters (lattice parameter, k-points, unique k-points, etc). A good k-point grid to use is 4 × 4 × 4. Plot and record your results.
