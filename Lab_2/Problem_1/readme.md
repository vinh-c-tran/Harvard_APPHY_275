# Problem 1: Convergence of Absolute Energies with Respect to Cutoff Energies

A. Using Quantum Espresso PWscf, calculate the energy of Ge in the diamond structure as a function of palne-wave cutoff energy. A good range to try is 5-80 Ry, doing calculations at increments of 5 Ry, keeping other variables constant. Record and plot final results. Specify when you reach the level of convewrgence of aorund 5 meV/atom. Note that the code calculates energy per primitive cell (not atom). 

B. Do you see a trend in your calculated energies and calculation time with respect to the cutoff? Is this what you expect and why? 

C. Cubic unit cell vs primitive cell. Advantages and disadvantages of both?
