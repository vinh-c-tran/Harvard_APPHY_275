# Problem 4: Convergence of Forces with respect to k-points

Using PWscf, calculate the force on a Ge atom displaced +0.05 in the z direction (in fractional coordinates) as a function of k-point grid size. Keep all other parameters fixed. Record your relevant conditions (lattice parameter, cutoffs, etc).

## Background
This is exactly the same as problem 3 except in this case we're changing the k-points rather than the cut off energy.
