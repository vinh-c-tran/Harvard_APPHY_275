# Problem 4: Convergence of Forces with respect to k-points

Using PWscf, calculate the force on a Ge atom displaced +0.05 in the z direction (in frac- tional coordinates) as a function of k-point grid size. Keep all other parameters fixed. Record your relevant conditions (lattice parameter, cutoffs, etc).
