# Problem 1: Iron - Stability Under Pressure and Magnetism 

You will calculate energies of different structures using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof(PBE) GGA exchange-correlation functional. Use a wavefunction cutoff of 30 Ry along with charge density cutoff 300 Ry. A good k-point mesh is not given to you; you will have to find this yourself. We are going to compare the energies of the HCP and BCC structures. Note that the energy difference will be very small. Energies should be converged to within 2meV/atom.
