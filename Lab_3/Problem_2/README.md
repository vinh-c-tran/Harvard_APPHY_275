# Problem 2: Stability of the perovskite: A case study Lead Titanate 

PbTiO3 is a perovskite oxide which is ferroelectric. The ferroelectric response of PbTiO3 is the result of a displacive transition where a low temperature tetragonal phase is preferred over the cubic phase. In this problem, we will study the energetics of cubic PbTiO3 and use first principles calculations to gather information pertaining to the displacive transition to the tetragonal phase.
