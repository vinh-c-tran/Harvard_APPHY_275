# Part 1: Calculate and Plot Energy of Cubic

## Constructing the Structure
Perovskites, where in this case we have something of the form ABO3, form a cubic structure with a unit cell where we have a A's in the corner positions, B's at the body-center position, and the oxygens at the face-center position. 

To start, we need to generate the unit cell for this structure. We can begin by building this structure in `ASE` and visualizing it in a `Jupyter` notebook.
