# Part 2

## Introduction 
Using the equilibrium lattice parameter from part (A), plot the energy as a function of displacement of the Ti atom along one of the cubic lattice directions, allowing the O atoms to fully relax for each displacement. Report the Ti displacement at which the total energy is at a minimum. What is the energy difference between this configuration and the minimum-energy configuration from part (A)? Be aware that for PbTiO3, the Ti displacement will be very small.
