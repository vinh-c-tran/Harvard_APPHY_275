# Problem 3: Stability of CuAu Alloy

1. <b> Calculate the equilibrium lattice parameters for FCC Cu and Au, with energy- differences converged to 0.3mHa/atom </b>

Explore the convergence of k-point sampling for FCC Cu and Au using LDA ultrasoft pseudopotentials with a plane-wave energy cutoff ecutwfc=40 Ryd and charge density cutoff ecutrho=320 Ryd.

2. <b> Different unit-cell representations of the 50-50% solution of CuAu </b> 
3. L10 is the name associated to the ordered phase of CuAu corresponding to a solution of 50% Cu and 50% Au. One possible representation of L10 CuAu is the pseudo-face- centered tetragonal (pfct) unit-cell shown (’pseudo’ refers to the fact that the unit-cell has two different types of atoms in the middle of the faces). Show how you can describe the L10 CuAu structure by using a smaller body centered tetragonal (bct) unit-cell in- stead of the the unit-cell shown above. Show how the lattice parameters c and a of the new bct cell relate to the lattice parameters c and a of the pfct unit-cell reported above.
